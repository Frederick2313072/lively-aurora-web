**Who I am:**
I am an undergraduate student majoring in Statistics and Data Science at Nankai University, focusing on full-stack development and AI application development. In my graduate studies, I may pursue agentic AI or blockchain technology.

**Some of my thoughts:**
The essence of a startup is to innovatively solve the needs of a niche market. The scope of human social activities is finite; regardless of how productivity levels iterate, the total number of need-types remains relatively constant. What grows exponentially are the methods to solve them. But no matter how fancy or complex a solution appears, its core purpose must be to solve the problem.

All good products or solutions must be: **Intuitive + Transferable + Interactive + Smart**.

**Intuitive:** You can understand how it works at a glance.

**Transferable:** It is easy to migrate from previous solutions.

**Interactive:** It possesses interactive attributes (since humans are social animals).

**Smart:** It doesn't require significant mental effort to use.

My blueprint for the future of software is that it can evolve into any software a human asks it to become through natural language.
